# Info

This is a homework planner that I coded in Java for AP CSA. The program was coded using IntelliJ IDEA which is an IDE for java development. The program features a GUI which allows the user to easily view and edit their homework assignments. The user can also save the list of assignments they created to a text file and load this information later. 

## Installation

Download the RUN ME.exe file if you simply want to run the program.

Download the PROJECT.zip file if you would like to make changes or view the code. 

## Usage

Button Functions are as follows:

Save File - Saves the current list of assignments

Load File - Prints the most recent saved list of assignments (with details) in the command prompt 

Create New - Creates a new default assignment

Save Existing - Saves existing assignment

Delete - Deletes an assignment

Days Remaining - Displays the remaining days until an assignment is due (0 if < 1 day)
